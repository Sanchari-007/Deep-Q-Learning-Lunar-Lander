# 🚀 Deep Q-Learning: Lunar Lander

This repository contains my implementation of **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** to solve the **Lunar Lander** problem using the OpenAI Gym environment. The project walks through key concepts of reinforcement learning, agent training, and performance evaluation in a step-by-step manner using Jupyter Notebook.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Understand the dynamics of the Lunar Lander environment
- Apply Deep Q-Learning to train an agent for safe landing
- Implement concepts like:
  - Experience Replay
  - Target Networks
  - Network Updates
  - Exploration vs Exploitation (ε-greedy policy)
